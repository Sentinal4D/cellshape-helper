___
Cellshape-helper is an easy-to-use tool to analyse the shapes of cells using deep learning and, 
in particular, 
3D convolutional neural networks. The tool provides the ability to convert masks to point clouds.


## To install
```bash
pip install cellshape-helper
```

## Usage
```python

```

## Parameters




## For developers
* Fork the repository
* Clone your fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/cellshape-helper 
```
* Install an editable version (`-e`) with the development requirements (`dev`)
```bash
cd cellshape-voxel
pip install -e .[dev] 
```
* To install pre-commit hooks to ensure formatting is correct:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

* To release a new version:

Firstly, update the version with bump2version (`bump2version patch`, 
`bump2version minor` or `bump2version major`). This will increment the 
package version (to a release candidate - e.g. `0.0.1rc0`) and tag the 
commit. Push this tag to GitHub to run the deployment workflow:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

Once the release candidate has been tested, the release version can be created with:

```bash
bump2version release
```
